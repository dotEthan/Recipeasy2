All backend functionality is broken.

### Status

Rebuild Underway with Vue

## Overview and Thoughts

### What's Working

Just started, wanted to learn Vue and previous app hadn't been kept up so many dependencies were out of date or no longer updated.

### What isn't working

Slow and steady win the race

## Where are we?

### Done:

- Learn Vue/Router/Store functionality thought docs
- authentication (through firebase)
- Recipe Book Functionality (display, edit, crud with firebase)

### Working on Now:

- Routing & Store (ongoing as needed)
- Recipe Book Functionality (delete & shopping list integration)

### To Come:

- Redesign
- Shopping List Functionality
- basic backend
- Animations/Testing

### Future thoughts:

- bespoke Backend Functionality
- Meal Planning & Calendar
- Website Parsing to allow importing recipes
- Calorie counter
