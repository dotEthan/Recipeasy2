All backend functionality is broken.

### Status

Rebuild Underway with Vue

## Overview and Thoughts

### What's Working

Just started, wanted to learn Vue and previous app hadn't been kept up so many dependencies were out of date or no longer updated.

### What isn't working

Slow and steady win the race

## Where are we?

### Done:

- Learn Vue/Router/Store functionality thought docs

### Working on Now:

- Routing & Store (ongoing as needed)
- Header (Authorization/save/load missing, CSS incomplete)
- Recipe Book Functionality (Mock data creation, filtering options, design)
- Authorization (firebase)

### To Come:

- Shopping List Functionality
- basic backend
- Animations/Testing

### Future thoughts:

- bespoke Backend Functionality
- Meal Planning & Calendar
- Website Parsing to allow importing recipes
- Calorie counter

## Built With

- HTML
